# Remove Game Bar feature üéÆ

I created this script because of the **stupid popup** in **Tiny11**

This script can either be used to __completely remove ‚ùå Game Bar__ on Windows 11 or to *just fix the Popup*

Thanks to some research on Reddit, this is THE perfect script to make your PC just a little bit cleaner to use :^)
